## Introduction

Text preprocessing is a crucial step in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including text classification. It involves cleaning and transforming raw text data into a format suitable for analysis and modeling. Feature selection aims to identify the most relevant features (words or terms) that contribute the most to the classification task.

This code snippet demonstrates text preprocessing techniques such as tokenization, stop word removal, and lemmatization using the NLTK library. It then utilizes mutual information to rank features based on their information gain, providing insights into which terms are most informative for classification.

## Setup

To run the code, you need to have Python installed along with the following dependencies:

- pandas
- nltk
- scikit-learn

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas nltk scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/text-preprocessing-feature-selection.git
cd text-preprocessing-feature-selection
```

2. Run the Python script:

```bash
python text_preprocessing_feature_selection.py
```

This will execute the code, preprocess the text data, calculate information gain for feature selection, and print the top features along with their information gains.
